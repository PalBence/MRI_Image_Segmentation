# MRI_Image_Segmentation
This is a GitHub repo for the final project corresponding to the Advanced Machine Learning course, taught by Petra Kralj-Novak at Central European University, completed in 2024, during the 2nd year of the BSc Data Science Program by Bence PÃ¡l and Christoph Kurzbauer. The repository includes the Jupyter Notebook file and a pdf presentation corresponding to the project. It is important to mention that the Jupyter Notebook was created in Google Colab so code / requirements can change and produce errors when trying to run it on local computers.
